# Fix Key Error 6

This is a clone of 'Fix Key Error 5' and does exactly the same.
If there is an exception due to missing age data for horses (because of outdated override package files) age data of a human will be returned which is hopfully compatible.

To modify package files correctly use either Live-XML or Patch-XML (links below). 

# Addendum

## Game compatibility
This mod has been tested with `The Sims 4` 1.111.102, S4CL 3.9, TS4Lib 0.3.33.
It is expected to be compatible with many upcoming releases of TS4, S4CL and TS4Lib.

## Dependencies
Download the ZIP file, not the sources.
* [This Mod](../../releases/latest)
* [TS4-Library](https://github.com/Oops19/TS4-Library/releases/latest)
* [S4CL](https://github.com/ColonolNutty/Sims4CommunityLibrary/releases/latest)
* [The Sims 4](https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4)

If not installed download and install TS4 and these mods.
All are available for free.

## Installation
* Locate the localized `The Sims 4` folder which contains the `Mods` folder.
* Extract the ZIP file into this `The Sims 4` folder.
* It will create the directories/files `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.ts4script`, `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.package`, `mod_data/$mod_name/*` and/or `mod_documentation/$mod_name/*`
* `mod_logs/$mod_name.txt` will be created as soon as data is logged.

### Manual Installation
If you don't want to extract the ZIP file into `The Sims 4` folder you might want to read this. 
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_data` are usually required and should be extracted to `The Sims 4/mod_data`.
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_documentation` are for you to read it. They are not needed to use this mod.
* The `Mods/_o19_/*.ts4script` files can be stored in a random folder within `Mods` or directly in `Mods`. I highly recommend to store it in `_o19_` so you know who created it.

## Usage Tracking / Privacy
This mod does not send any data to tracking servers. The code is open source, not obfuscated, and can be reviewed.

Some log entries in the log file ('mod_logs' folder) may contain the local username, especially if files are not found (WARN, ERROR).
